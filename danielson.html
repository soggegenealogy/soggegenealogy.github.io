      <h1>Danielson</h1>

      <p style="text-align:justify">Mathias and Johanna Danielson came to America with all of their children except for Karen, who came with her mother's family in 1868, on the vessel NEW BRUNSWICK. Mathias Danielson's parents were Daniel Hansen Ristad, who was born in 1786 in Vemundvik, and Olava Nielsdatter. Johanna Ottesdatter's parents were Otte Erickson, who was born in 1807 in Vemundvik, and Juliane Olsdatter, who was born on April 22, 1804 in Overhall.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">After arriving in America, the Danielsons lived for two years in Almakee County, Iowa. They then moved to Jackson County, Minnesota, where they farmed for 16 years. From Minnesota, the family moved to an area near the town of Irving, Wisconsin.</p>
