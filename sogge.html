      <h1>Sogge</h1>

      <p style="text-align:justify">In Norway, the name is pronounced Sajjin, dative Sagga, genitive Sagg. In Aslak Bolt’s book, it is written Sogdom. In Norwegian Accountings and Land Books from 1514-1521, it is written Sodeighe. In Olav Engelbrektson’s Land Book from 1530, it is written as Sugge. In 1590, it is written as Sogge; in 1643, it is written as Souge; and in 1661 and 1723, it is written as Sogge. In Old Norse, the name is Sodgar, which comes from the verb <i>sjoda</i>, which means "to boil," in reference to a river or current.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">No one knows exactly what the name Sogge means. It has been said that it has something to do with the sound from the river, though it is only during special weather that the sound can be heard. It is the sound that water makes when it is swirling, such as in a whirlpool.</p>
