      <h1>Klungtveit (Twait)</h1>

      <p style="text-align:justify">The Klungtveits immigrated to America in multiple trips. The first to emigrate was Daniel Danielsen. His father were Daniel Nilsen Klungtvedt, who was born in 1803 on the Klungtveit farm and died on March 28, 1857, and his mother was Dorte Knutsdatter Hustoft, who was born in 1806 and died on May 6, 1876. Later, three of Daniel's nephews, who were all brothers with each other, immigrated to America. The first was Borre Nilsen. Then, Nils Nilsen and Syvert Nilsen emigrated together from the Norwegian port of Stavanger to London and then to New York. Passport records for the port of Stavanger burned in 1929, so further information is difficult to obtain. The brothers' father was Nils Danielsen Klungtveit, who was born in 1829 on the Klungtveit farm and died on April 10, 1884. Their mother was Dorthe Bjornsdatter Vestbo, who was born in 1830 and died in 1917. Daniel, Borre, Nils, and Syvert all changed their last name to Twait in America.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">After the first four emigrated, the Reverend Nils Klungtvedt, who was a nephew of Borre, Nils, and Syvert, also immigrated to America. His father was their older brother, Daniel Nilsen, who was born on April 12, 1856 and died on February 2, 1924. His mother was Anna Torgersdatter who was born on March 8, 1858 and died on April 29, 1917.</p>
